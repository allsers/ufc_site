    </ul>
    <p>We combine information we receive from other sources with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We use this combined information for the purposes set out above.</p>
    <p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>We do share data with third parties, including event sponsors and Endeavor, and the other categories of partners as listed above. Some of these disclosures of data may constitute a sale of data under some data privacy laws.

        <li>to any other third party not covered in this policy with your prior consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>MARKETING AND ADVERTISING</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Targeted Advertising</strong></p>
    <p>We use your personal information to tailor our marketing and advertising efforts. To do this, we provide your information to third party advertising networks (such as Google Doubleclick) and social media companies (such as Facebook). When we provide data to agencies, ad networks, and other parties for targeted advertising, we do not provide them with your name, financial information, or any sensitive information (such as a government ID or date of birth, if we have collected that). We use online identifiers such as email, cookie addresses, and device identifiers to help us provide targeted advertising to you and others like you. We may also use aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to target audiences.</p>
    <p>To opt out of targeted advertising, you may use the following links provided by third parties that manage opt outs for some ad networks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners">https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Email Marketing</strong></p>
    <p>We may also add you to our mailing lists for email communications from UFC and our partners, including Endeavor, when you sign up for our mailing lists, purchase a ticket or UFC merchandise, or subscribe to UFC content online. If you provide us with your email address in order to receive communications, you can opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe links at the bottom of our emails.</p>
    <p><strong>Mobile Notifications</strong></p>
    <p>With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.</p>
    <p><strong>SOCIAL SHARING</strong></p>
    <p>You may be able to use social sharing features and other integrated tools on the Site such as the Facebook "Like" button. These features and tools may permit you to share actions you take on our Service with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the service that provides the social sharing feature. Please remember, though, that use of the information you share on social media sites will be governed by the privacy policies of the social media provider, and we are not responsible for how they treat the information.</p>
    <p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
    <p>We and trusted third parties use cookies and similar technologies on the Site to collect and process personal information. For more information, please see our Cookie Notice.</p>
    <p><strong>DO NOT TRACK</strong></p>
    <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether you intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether you even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.</p>
    <p><strong>STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>We operate the Services in and from a number of different jurisdictions, but the Site is primarily operated from the United States, which is where your information will likely be stored and processed. Your information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to legal process in the countries in which we operate and/or store your information.</p>
    <p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect information from children who are under 13 years old. If you are a parent or guardian of a child who is 13-16 years old and using our Services, please send us an email at dataprivacy@ufc.com to opt in or request deletion of any personal information we may have collected about the child. If you are a parent or guardian of a child who is under 13 years old and using our Services, please contact us to arrange for deletion of any personal information we may have collected about the child.</p>
    <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>WE DO NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR MONEY.</p>
    <p>However, sometimes we share your data with sponsors, vendors, Endeavor, and third party advertising networks. These transfers, which are used to provide you with certain Services and/or to more effectively provide you with personalized Services (including advertising), can be deemed a sale under some data privacy laws.</p>
    <p>You may opt out of the sale of your personal information by clicking on the Do Not Sell My Personal Information button on our site or calling 1-866-983-0571. You will be asked to provide certain information to us in order to exercise this option so we can verify your identity and locate your records with us.</p>
    <p>Please note that your decision to opt out of the sale of your personal information may impact the availability and quality of some of the Services provided to you. For example, if you choose to opt out of the sale of your personal information with regard to UFC FIGHT PASS, your account will need to be suspended because the service relies on certain data to function.</p>
    <p><strong>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
    <p>California residents have certain rights with respect to the personal information collected by businesses. If you are a California resident, you may exercise the following rights regarding your personal information, subject to our ability to verify your request and certain other limitations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information about You: You may ask for us to state what categories of personal information about you we have, and the categories of sources from which we collect your personal information;</li>
        <li>Receive a Copy of Your Data: You may request the categories and specific pieces of information (if any) we have about you, the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about you for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties with which we have shared personal information in the previous 12 months.</li>
        <li>Delete Your Data: You may request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you.</li>
        <li>Do-Not-Sell: You may opt out of our sale(s) of your personal information, as “sale” is defined by California law. Please see above for more information.</li>
        <li>Non-Discrimination: California law prohibits discrimination against you for exercising your privacy rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Where certain technologies rely on your data to provide the Services, the absence of that data may impact the operation of the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Exercise Your Rights</strong></p>
    <p>To exercise any of the above rights, please follow the instructions below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By phone at 1-866-983-0571</li>

    <p><strong>Verification Process and Required Information</strong></p>
    <p>All requests must be verified. Some requests, including receiving a copy of your data or requests made by an agent claiming to be acting on your behalf, are subject to heightened requirements. If we cannot verify your identity based on the information provided, a request for a copy of your data shall be treated as a request for information and if we cannot verify your identity, a request to delete personal information may be treated as a request to opt-out of the sale of personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Authorized Agent</strong></p>
    <p>You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. An Authorized Agent must have written documentation of their authority to act on your behalf, such as a Power of Attorney.</p>
    <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
    <p>We use a variety of administrative, physical, and technology solutions, including engaging with qualified cybersecurity companies, to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. Because there is always some risk in transmitting information over the internet and otherwise processing information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information that you transmit on or through the Services or that we otherwise maintain.</p>
    <p><strong>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong></p>
    <p>Our Services, newsletters, email updates and other communications may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of others, including our partner networks, retail partners, advertisers and affiliates.
